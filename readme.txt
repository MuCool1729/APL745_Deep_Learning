These code can also be found on "https://github.com/MuCool1729/APL745_Deep_Learning"
I have not explained the results that i got.


I trained all the 14 configurations and plotted ther graphs too.

As far as i remember there will not be any module required other than given, but if you fin something is missing
like the torch summary module install it via 
!pip install torch_summary
